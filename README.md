# 🚀 Project Overview

**InsightAI allows users to:**

Interact with Data in Natural Language: Ask questions about datasets and receive relevant Python code instantly.

Generate Accurate Pandas Code: Powered by LLAMA-based models, ensuring reliable and efficient data processing.

Retrieve Relevant Context: Using FAISS and LangChain's RetrievalQA for enhanced query understanding.

Visualize Data Live: Matplotlib-powered visualizations update in real-time alongside generated code.

## 🌟**Key Features**

1. Conversational data analysis powered by Llama-2-7b-chat-quantized model.

2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware responses.

3. Real-time data visualization with Matplotlib.

4. Interactive user interface built with Gradio.

5. Context retention across queries using LangChain Memory.
